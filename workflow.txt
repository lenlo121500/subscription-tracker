Workflows

1. Triggering the Workflow - The workflow begins whenever a user creates or submits a new subscription. We pass the created subscription ID to the workflow.

2. Retrieving Subscription Details 
    - The process extracts the subscription ID from the context.
    - It then searches for the corresponding subscription in the database.

3. Validation Checks 
    - If the subscription does not exist, an error is logged, and the process terminates.
    - If the subscription exists, its status is checked: 
        - If inactive, the status is logged, and the process exits.
        - If active, the renewal date is verified.

4. Renewal Date Evaluation
    - If the renewal date has passed, it logs this information and exits. 
    - If the renewal date is in the future, the reminder loop begins.

5. Reminder Scheduling
    - For each predefined reminder:
        - The reminder date is calculated.
        - if the reminder date is in the future, the system waits until that time.
        - Once the reminder date arrives (or if it has already passed), the reminder email is sent.

6. Completion 
    - The process repeats for all reminders in the list.
    - After processing all reminders, the workflow concludes.
